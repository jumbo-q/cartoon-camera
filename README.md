## Asset Paths 📁

*   **3D Models:** Place your 3D models in the `/assets/3d-models/` directory and link them using the `a-entity` tag in `index.html`. [Learn more](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/marker-based/#a-frame). 📦
*   **Markers:**
  *   The app defaults to the [hiro marker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/data/images/hiro.png). 🎯
  *   To create a custom marker:
1.  Use [this tool](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html) to generate your custom marker. 🛠️
2.  Export the `.patt` file and place it in `/assets/custom-markers/`.

*   **Capture the Moment:** Translate, rotate, or zoom your 3D model to your liking, and then snap a pic! 📸
